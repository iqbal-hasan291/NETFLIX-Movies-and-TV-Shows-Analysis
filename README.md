![image alt](Cover_2.jpg)

## Overview
This project aims to analyze Netflix‚Äôs content using structured SQL queries to derive meaningful business insights. The analysis covers content type distribution, country-wise trends, director and actor performance, content ratings, and viewer-relevant classifications.

## Goals
Explore trends and patterns across Netflix‚Äôs movies and TV shows.
Identify popular genres, ratings, and contributing countries.
Discover content gaps (e.g., missing directors) and top contributors (e.g., directors, actors).
Classify content based on keywords and viewer perceptions.

## Tools Used
**Database:** PostgreSQL
**Language:** SQL
**Dataset:** Netflix content database (includes show_id, type, title, director, casts, country, date_added, release_year, rating, duration, listed_in, description)

## Key Business Questions Solved
1Ô∏è‚É£ Count of Movies vs TV Shows
Reveals content distribution across types using GROUP BY.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Most Common Rating per Type
Uses RANK() to extract the top rating per content type.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Movies Released in 2020
Simple filter to show content by year and type.

4Ô∏è‚É£ Top 5 Countries by Content Count
Breaks down multi-country fields using STRING_TO_ARRAY and ranks by content volume.

5Ô∏è‚É£ Longest Movie on Netflix
Parses duration to find the longest movie using SPLIT_PART.

6Ô∏è‚É£ Content Added in the Last 5 Years
Converts date_added string to date for temporal filtering.

7Ô∏è‚É£ Top 3 Directors by Movie Count
Uses UNNEST and TRIM to extract director names and aggregate.

8Ô∏è‚É£ TV Shows With More Than 5 Seasons
Filters TV shows based on season count using string parsing.

9Ô∏è‚É£ Top 5 Genres on Netflix
Unpacks genres using UNNEST, then counts appearances.

üîü Average Annual Indian Releases
Calculates the percentage of Indian content released per year.

1Ô∏è‚É£1Ô∏è‚É£ Bangladeshi Movies
Searches titles using ILIKE '%Bangladesh%'.

1Ô∏è‚É£2Ô∏è‚É£ Content Without Directors
Counts entries with NULL director fields.

1Ô∏è‚É£3Ô∏è‚É£ Salman Khan Movies (Last 10 Years)
Uses UNNEST, TRIM, and filtering by actor and date.

1Ô∏è‚É£4Ô∏è‚É£ Top 10 Indian Actors by Movie Count
Ranks most frequent actors in Indian content using UNNEST.

1Ô∏è‚É£5Ô∏è‚É£ Classify Content as "Good" or "Bad"
Uses CASE with ILIKE on the description to label and count content based on violent keywords.

## Insights & Learnings
Netflix contains more Movies than TV Shows.
The most common ratings vary significantly by type.
India, USA, UK, Canada, and Japan are top content contributors.
Some actors and directors dominate specific regional markets.
Several records lack director information‚Äîdata quality opportunity.
Content with violent keywords exists and can be filtered or flagged for parental control purposes.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates how SQL can be used to extract deep business insights from streaming platform data. Whether it‚Äôs for content acquisition, regional strategy, or consumer sentiment filtering, structured queries can drive data-informed decisions.
