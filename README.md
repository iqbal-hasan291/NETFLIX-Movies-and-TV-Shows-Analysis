## Overview
This project aims to analyze Netflix‚Äôs content using structured SQL queries to derive meaningful business insights. The analysis covers content type distribution, country-wise trends, director and actor performance, content ratings, and viewer-relevant classifications.

Identify popular genres, ratings, and contributing countries.
Discover content gaps (e.g., missing directors) and top contributors (e.g., directors, actors).
Classify content based on keywords and viewer perceptions.

## Tools Used

Content with violent keywords exists and can be filtered or flagged for parental control purposes.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates how SQL can be used to extract deep business insights from streaming platform data. Whether it‚Äôs for content acquisition, regional strategy, or consumer sentiment filtering, structured queries can drive data-informed decisions.
